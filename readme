This is the readme for CSE Assignment-3 by Manvith Reddy - 2018101057

The libraries that have been used are standard.(Readline library is only on some compilers
and must be installed prior to using my shell.)

To run:
-> make
-> ./a.out

main.c
        :          This file has the main shell implementation which calls the rest of the files
                   to implement commands on the shell. This file also has some commands implementation
                   like history, exit and some system calls.
                   - input-output redirection
                   - piping
                   - setenv
                   - jobs
                   - bg,fg
                   - ctrl-c, ctrl-z
                   - command recall
                   - cronjob
                       <executable> <input file>

<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

address.c
        :           This file has two functions which is used to check current address and extract
                    file name from full path

<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

builtcommands.c
        :           This file has three builtin functions such as pwd, cd and echo with full implementation
                    as prescribed in the question.

<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

input.c
        :           This file has two functions which is used to seperate the string into commands, and the
                    commands into various arguments and flags for the commands.

ls.c
        :           This file has the full implementation of the ls command with support for -a, -l, -la
                    flags along with support for files and directories.
